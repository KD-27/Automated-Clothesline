Assumptions
 max wet mass 0.4 kg 
 max wet load = 0.4 × 9.81 =3.924 N
 mass of the hanger is negligible
  Air resistance is negligible

Normal reaction force per hanger
R = 3.924 N
Frictional force generated
F =  µR
Railing is made of aluminum and  mild steel 
µ static = 0.61 
(https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/friction-coefficients-d_778.html)
F = 0.61×3.924 = 2.393 N

For 15 hangers;
Total force = 15 × 2.393 = 35.904 N 

Torque calculation;
Torque(T) = P × r

where;
            P is the  force required 
            r is the radius of the shaft/ pulley
 
P =  load of the hangers
P = 35.904 N
r = 0. 06 m
T = 35.904 × 0.06 = 2.154 Nm

T is the torque required by the motor
