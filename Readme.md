1. The code includes the library `NewPing.h`, which is used for ultrasonic sensor functionality.

2. The code defines the pin numbers for the ultrasonic sensor's trigger and echo pins (`TRIGGER_PIN` and `ECHO_PIN`) and the maximum distance to measure (`MAX_DISTANCE`).

3. Two variables, `ultra_threshold_1` and `ultra_threshold_2`, are defined to set the thresholds for the ultrasonic sensor distances.

4. An instance of the `NewPing` class called `sonar` is created using the defined pin numbers and maximum distance.

5. The code defines the pin number for the LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor (`LDRpin`) and initializes a variable `value` to store the LDR sensor reading.

6. A character variable `blue` is defined to store the received data from a Bluetooth connection.

7. The code defines the pin number for the rain sensor (`sensorPin`).

8. Two variables, `int1` and `int2`, are defined to control the motor's direction.

9. The code defines the pin number for a switch (`switchPin`) and sets it as an input with the internal pull-up resistor enabled.

10. The `setup()` function is called once during the initialization phase.

11. In the `setup()` function, the serial communication is started at a baud rate of 9600. The necessary pin modes for the rain sensor, LDR sensor, motor control pins, and switch are set.

12. Pin 3 is set as an output, and the motor speed is set to 100 using `analogWrite()`.

13. The `loop()` function is called repeatedly.

14. Within the `loop()` function, it checks if there is any data available from the serial communication.

15. If data is available, it reads the data into the `blue` variable and prints it to the serial monitor.

16. The current state of the switch is read and stored in the `switchState` variable.

17. The value of the LDR sensor is read and stored in the `value` variable.

18. The ultrasonic sensor's distance is measured and stored in the `distance` variable.

19. The distance and LDR sensor value are printed to the serial monitor.

20. The `rainSensor()` function is called, and its return value is printed to the serial monitor.

21. Depending on the value of `blue` and the state of the switch, different actions are performed.

22. If `blue` is '0' and the switch state is HIGH, it checks the light intensity and the rain sensor value.

23. If the light intensity is lower than 500 or the rain sensor value is greater than 10, it calls the `ClothsMovingToTheShelter()` function.

24. If the light intensity is higher than 500 and the rain sensor value is less than 10, it calls the `ClothsMovingAwayFromTheShelter()` function.

25. If `blue` is '1' or the switch state is LOW, it calls the `ClothsMovingToTheShelter()` function.

26. The `ClothsMovingToTheShelter()` function checks if the distance is greater than `ultra_threshold_1`. If true, it moves the motor closer to the shelter.

27. If the distance is less than `ultra_threshold_2`, the `ClothsMovingAwayFromTheShelter()` function moves the motor away from the shelter.

28. The `rainSensor()` function reads the analog value from the rain sensor and maps it to a range of 255 to 0.

29. The mapped outputvalue is returned by the `rainSensor()` function.
